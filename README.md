This project makes for a small GPT model that generates text output somewhat similar in style to J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings".

To run it:
1. Copy this repo
2. From command line run *pip install -r requirements.txt*
3. From command line run *python3 main.py*

Important:
1. **GPU is required!** Otherwise your computer simply won't be able to handle it.
2. Model takes some time to train - please be patient.
